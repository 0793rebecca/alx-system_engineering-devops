Postmortem: Web Stack Outage on December 18, 2023

Issue Summary:

    Duration:
        Start Time: December 18, 2023, 10:45 AM (UTC)
        End Time: December 18, 2023, 1:30 PM (UTC)
        Duration: 2 hours and 45 minutes

    Impact:
        The outage affected our main web application, causing a complete service unavailability for approximately 30% of our users. Users experienced slow response times, failed requests, and intermittent errors during the outage.

    Root Cause:
        The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an uneven distribution of traffic across backend servers.

Timeline:

    10:45 AM (UTC): Issue Detected
        Monitoring alerts triggered due to a sudden spike in error rates and latency.

    10:50 AM (UTC): Issue Identification
        Operations team noticed the anomalies and immediately began investigating the potential causes.

    11:05 AM (UTC): Initial Actions Taken
        Assumed a potential DDoS attack and started inspecting network traffic.
        Investigated backend servers for anomalies but found no immediate issues.

    11:30 AM (UTC): Misleading Investigation Paths
        Focused on database performance, suspecting a bottleneck, but no abnormalities were found.

    12:00 PM (UTC): Escalation
        Incident escalated to the DevOps team as the issue seemed to involve infrastructure components.
        Parallelly, communications sent to affected users acknowledging the problem and providing updates.

    12:30 PM (UTC): Resolution
        Identified load balancer misconfiguration leading to uneven distribution of traffic.
        Load balancer settings were corrected, and traffic redistribution verified.
        Normal service gradually restored, with complete recovery by 1:30 PM (UTC).

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause:
        Misconfiguration in load balancer settings caused uneven traffic distribution, leading to server overload and degraded performance.

    Resolution:
        Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic among backend servers.
        Automated checks implemented to prevent similar misconfigurations in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Conduct a comprehensive review of load balancer configurations for all services.
        Enhance monitoring alerts for quicker identification of traffic distribution issues.

    Tasks:

        Load Balancer Configuration Review:
            Task: Perform a detailed audit of load balancer configurations.
            Deadline: December 22, 2023.

        Monitoring Enhancement:
            Task: Update monitoring system to include alerts for uneven traffic distribution.
            Deadline: December 20, 2023.

        Documentation Update:
            Task: Document the incident, root cause, and resolution for future reference.
            Deadline: December 21, 2023.

        Training Session:
            Task: Conduct a training session for operations and DevOps teams on identifying and resolving load balancer issues.
            Deadline: January 10, 2024.

Conclusion:
